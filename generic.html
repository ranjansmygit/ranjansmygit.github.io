								<h2>Principal Security Engineer</h2>
								<p>As a Principal Security Engineer, I spearheaded the integration of security throughout the DevOps lifecycle for banking mobile applications, emphasizing automation and continuous security 
									within the CI/CD pipeline. Using SonarQube and Fortify for static code analysis, OWASP ZAP for dynamic application security testing, and Aqua Security for container vulnerability scanning, 
									I developed a secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework. This approach embedded automated vulnerability assessments, configuration management with Ansible, and infrastructure-as-code 
									checks using Terraform within the DevOps workflow. To further secure containerized environments in Docker and Kubernetes, I introduced image scanning, runtime security with Sysdig and Falco, 
									and role-based access control (RBAC) configurations, ensuring security compliance at each stage of deployment. 
									This comprehensive automation reduced human error and expedited secure application releases, significantly reducing security risks across multiple banking regions.</p>
								
								<h2>Security Solution Consultant</h2>
								<p>In my role as a Consultant, I focused on architecting secure solutions tailored to a microservices-based mobile banking ecosystem. 
									This included deploying API gateways with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect authentication, mutual TLS for secure communications, and JWT token-based authorization 
									for internal and external APIs. Leveraging Istio for service mesh security and Kong for API management, I established secure communication channels and automated rate limiting 
									and throttling to protect against API abuse. Additionally, I worked closely with development and DevOps teams to implement end-to-end encryption using TLS 1.3 and to ensure 
									compliance with PCI-DSS standards across microservices, reducing attack surfaces and enabling secure integrations with third-party services.</p>
								
								<h2>Product Security</h2>
								<p>As an Automation Security Expert, I utilized Bash and Python scripting to create automated frameworks for vulnerability management, security testing, and compliance reporting. 
									These frameworks integrated with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and CircleCI to automate static and dynamic code analysis, vulnerability reporting, and remediation processes. 
									By incorporating Snyk and Nessus for vulnerability scanning, I ensured continuous risk assessment and instant alerting on critical issues. Additionally, I automated compliance validation checks 
									using CIS benchmarks and AWS Config rules for cloud security, 
									reducing the time needed to address compliance gaps and fortifying the release process. This holistic automation approach streamlined the entire security process, 
									aligning security requirements seamlessly with agile development and deployment timelines.</p>

								<h2>Application Security Engineer</h2>
								<p>In conducting penetration testing, I leveraged tools such as Burp Suite, Metasploit, and Nmap to simulate attacks and evaluate the applicationâ€™s resilience against 
									both common and sophisticated threats. My methodology included SQL injection testing, cross-site scripting (XSS) evaluation, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) assessments, among other 
									OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. For mobile applications, I used MobSF (Mobile Security Framework) and Drozer to assess vulnerabilities unique to Android and iOS environments, 
									such as insecure storage and improper platform usage. 
									This approach provided the development teams with actionable insights and remediation recommendations, reducing critical security risks prior to deployment.</p>

								<h2>Projects</h2>
								<p>Designed and implemented robust automated security solutions for vulnerability management and brute-force attack detection. 
									For patch management, I developed an Automated Vulnerability Prioritization System using pandas and scikit-learn, enabling real-time risk assessment by aggregating data from 
									vulnerability scans and generating custom risk scores based on asset criticality and exploitability. By leveraging Gradient Boosting Classifier and K-means clustering for accurate 
									vulnerability ranking and grouping, coupled with matplotlib and Seaborn visualizations, I streamlined reporting and enabled security teams to focus on high-risk issues, 
									integrating this solution into Splunk and Jira for continuous monitoring and efficient remediation. In parallel, I developed a Login Pattern Analysis System for detecting 
									brute-force attacks on banking applications. This involved using DBSCAN clustering and Random Forest within a time-series framework to analyze login patterns and flag abnormal 
									login behavior in real time, effectively identifying brute-force attempts. The solution was fully integrated into the Splunk SIEM and visualized via matplotlib dashboards, 
									providing the Security Operations Center (SOC) with immediate, high-confidence alerts, thereby reducing unauthorized access risks and enhancing incident response efficiency.</p>
